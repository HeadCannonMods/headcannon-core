    /// Base class for implementing look/aim decoupling in FPS head tracking mods.
    ///
    /// CRITICAL CONCEPT - Look/Aim Decoupling:
    /// - LOOK direction = where the player's head is pointing (for rendering)
    /// - AIM direction = where the player is aiming (for game interactions)
    ///
    /// This component applies head tracking rotation ONLY during rendering (OnPreCull),
    /// then restores the original rotation after rendering (OnPostRender).
    ///
    /// Result:
    /// - Game logic (interactions, raycasts, FrobManager, etc.) sees the AIM direction
    /// - Rendering sees the LOOK direction with head tracking applied
    /// - Player can look around with head tracking while interactions remain at screen center
    ///
    /// Usage:
    /// 1. Inherit from this class
    /// 2. Override ComputeTrackedRotation() to return the head-tracked rotation
    /// 3. Override ShouldApplyTracking() to control when tracking is active
    /// 4. Optionally override OnPreCullComplete() and OnPostRenderComplete() for additional work
    /// 5. Attach to the main camera GameObject
